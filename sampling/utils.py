def check_scan_limits_context(context, param_dict, patchset_label, logger):
    """Decide whether hardcoded limits are still valid for this run's settings.

    Stored limits are only as good as the configuration they were probed with.
    Three settings invalidate them outright:

    * **signal uncertainty** - the probe injects the same ``histosys`` modifier
      the scan uses, so any change to ``sig_rel_unc`` can move the floor;
    * **a larger leakage spread** - a CR/VR bin's range is ``obs * spread``, so
      asking for a wider spread than was stored pushes the scan past the
      range that was actually verified;
    * **channel removal** (``removeCRsVRs`` / ``remove_channels``) - dropping a
      channel changes the likelihood itself, so a floor probed against the full
      model was never verified against the reduced one.

    A *smaller* spread is not unsafe - the stored box merely covers more than
    this run asked for - so it warns instead of forcing a recomputation. A
    region whose leakage is switched off is not checked at all: its bins are
    pinned on load and never move.

    Note the asymmetry between pinning and removal. Pinning keeps the channel in
    the workspace and freezes its bins, so the stored box still covers the
    run; removal builds a different model. That is why the harvest is always run
    with nothing removed, and why a run that removes channels recomputes.

    The check is HARD: limits are used only when every setting that matters for
    this run can be positively verified. A missing ``scan_limits_context``, or a
    context that does not record a setting this run depends on, means the limits
    are recomputed rather than trusted.
